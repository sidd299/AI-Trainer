```

### **Prompt Sent to Gemini:**

```markdown
You are a strength coach, and your goal is to suggest a personalized workout plan for **today** based on the user's inputs.

---

üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Workout Structure:**
Divide the workout into the following sections:
1. Warmup
2. Main Workout
3. Cardio
4. Cooldown

üí° For Cardio: Consider if the user plays a sport or has any preferred form of cardio.

---

üß† **Guardrails for Main Workout:**

**Fatigue & Split:**  
Understand the user's recent split and fatigue (from recent workouts). Avoid training the same muscle group as yesterday or over-fatiguing any area.

**Volume:**  
- Total exercises per session: 5‚Äì8  
- Exercises per muscle per day: ‚â§ 5  

**Variety:**  
Include different movement patterns within each muscle group.  
Vary across:
- **Type:** machine vs free weights  
- **Movement Type:** compound vs isolation  
- **Form:** standing / seated / incline / flat / decline / overhead / below-head  
- **Club:** press / fly / row / hinge / squat / lunge  
Avoid redundant selections (e.g., Barbell Bench Press + Dumbbell Bench Press).

**Difficulty Level (Based on Experience):**

- **Beginner (0‚Äì1 month):**  
  Exclude all barbell compound lifts (squat, deadlift, overhead press, barbell row), Olympic lifts, behind-the-neck variations, advanced core moves, and plyometrics.  
  Use stable, machine-based, or simple dumbbell/bodyweight exercises only.

- **Novice (1‚Äì3 months):**  
  Avoid Olympic lifts, behind-the-neck movements, advanced plyometrics, and very high-skill barbell lifts (snatch, clean & jerk).  
  You may introduce barbell squat, bench, and deadlift in light variations with strict form and low load.

## Example 2: Weight Suggestion for Single Exercise

### **Input to `/api/suggest-weights-ai`**

```json
{
  "user_context": "Name: John Doe, Age: 25, Gender: Male, Weight: 75kg, Experience: Intermediate (6 months), Goals: Hypertrophy and strength",
  "exercise_details": "Pull-ups - 4 sets of 8-10 reps",
  "user_id": "user-123"
}
```

### **Prompt Sent to Gemini:**

```markdown
You are an expert strength coach and exercise physiologist. Your task is to suggest optimal sets, reps, and weights for exercises based on the user's profile and exercise details.

## User Profile Context:
Name: John Doe, Age: 25, Gender: Male, Weight: 75kg, Experience: Intermediate (6 months), Goals: Hypertrophy and strength

## Exercise Details:
Pull-ups - 4 sets of 8-10 reps

## Guidelines for Weight Suggestions:

### 1. **Experience-Based Recommendations:**
- **Beginner (0-1 month)**: Start with very light weights, focus on form
- **Novice (1-3 months)**: Light to moderate weights, building confidence
- **Intermediate (3-12 months)**: Moderate weights, progressive overload
- **Advanced (1+ years)**: Higher weights, advanced techniques

### 2. **Exercise-Specific Considerations:**
- **Compound movements** (squat, deadlift, bench press): Higher weight, lower reps
- **Isolation exercises** (curls, extensions): Lower weight, higher reps
- **Machine exercises**: Can handle slightly higher weights safely
- **Dumbbell exercises**: Consider unilateral strength differences

### 3. **Set and Rep Guidelines:**
- **Strength focus**: 3-5 sets, 4-6 reps, higher weight
- **Hypertrophy focus**: 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, moderate weight
- **Endurance focus**: 2-3 sets, 15+ reps, lighter weight
- **Beginner focus**: 2-3 sets, 10-15 reps, very light weight

### 4. **Progressive Loading:**
- **Warmup sets**: 50-70% of working weight
- **Working sets**: 80-100% of target weight
- **Final set**: Can be 100-110% for advanced users

### 5. **Safety Considerations:**
- Never suggest weights that could cause injury
- Consider user's body weight for relative strength
- Account for gender differences in strength standards
- Ensure proper form can be maintained

## Output Format:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "exercise_name": "Exercise Name",
  "sets": [
    {
      "id": "set-1",
      "type": "warmup",
      "reps": 10,
      "weight": 20,
      "completed": false
    },
    {
      "id": "set-2", 
      "type": "working",
      "reps": 8,
      "weight": 30,
      "completed": false
    },
    {
      "id": "set-3",
      "type": "working", 
      "reps": 8,
      "weight": 30,
      "completed": false
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these weights were chosen (2-3 sentences)",
  "safety_notes": "Any important safety considerations for this exercise"
}

## Important Notes:
- Weight should be in kg
- Include 2-4 sets total
- First set should be warmup (50-70% of working weight)
- Subsequent sets should be working sets
- Consider the user's experience level and body weight
- Ensure weights are realistic and safe
- Provide reasoning for your choices

Return only the JSON, no additional text or formatting.
```

### **Expected Response from Gemini:**

```json
{
  "exercise_name": "Pull-ups",
  "sets": [
    {
      "id": "set-1",
      "type": "warmup",
      "reps": 10,
      "weight": 0,
      "completed": false
    },
    {
      "id": "set-2",
      "type": "working",
      "reps": 8,
      "weight": 0,
      "completed": false
    },
    {
      "id": "set-3",
      "type": "working",
      "reps": 8,
      "weight": 0,
      "completed": false
    },
    {
      "id": "set-4",
      "type": "working",
      "reps": 8,
      "weight": 0,
      "completed": false
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Pull-ups are a bodyweight exercise. At 75kg bodyweight with intermediate experience, you should be able to perform strict pull-ups with your own bodyweight. If needed, use assistance bands for warmup set. Progress by adding weighted vest or belt once bodyweight reps become easy.",
  "safety_notes": "Use full range of motion - chin over bar at top, full arm extension at bottom. Avoid swinging or kipping. Keep shoulders engaged throughout. If struggling, use resistance band assistance."
}
```

**Note:** For weighted exercises like barbell rows, the response would include actual weight values in kg.

        "Lateral raises - 3 sets of 12-15 reps"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

User Context (Dynamic - Updated with each conversation):

Recent Chat History:
user: Hey coach
assistant: Hello! How can I help you with your workout today?

User's Current Message:
I want to add more leg work today, can we add barbell squats and leg press?

Instructions:
1. Be conversational and supportive. Reference the current workout when relevant.
2. If the user mentions new preferences, goals, constraints, injuries, dislikes, schedule, or notes, extract them.
3. Keep responses concise - MAXIMUM 60-70 words.
4. If you suggest workout changes, mention that you'll need to confirm the changes.

Format your response EXACTLY like this (replace content but keep the delimiters):
<<<RESPONSE_START>>>
Your conversational response here (plain text, can use multiple paragraphs and line breaks)
<<<RESPONSE_END>>>
<<<CONTEXT_START>>>
preferences: preference1, preference2
goals: goal1, goal2
constraints: constraint1
dislikes: dislike1

### **Expected Response from Gemini:**

```
<<<RESPONSE_START>>>
Great! Adding barbell squats and leg press is a smart move for leg development. I can definitely incorporate these compound movements for hypertrophy. Since you already have upper body exercises, I'll create a balanced push-pull-legs workout. Would you like me to update your plan?
<<<RESPONSE_END>>>

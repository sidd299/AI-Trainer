## üîë Key Components

### 1. **Gemini API Configuration**

**Base URL:** `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models`

**Model Fallback Chain (Priority Order):**
1. `gemini-2.0-flash` (Primary - faster, cheaper)
2. `gemini-1.5-flash` (Fallback)
3. `gemini-1.5-pro` (Fallback)
4. `gemini-pro` (Last resort)

**Rate Limiting Strategy:**
- 2-second delay between consecutive weight generation API calls
- Model availability testing before each major operation

**Generation Config (Standard):**
```json
{
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "topK": 40,
  "topP": 0.95,
  "maxOutputTokens": 1024
}
```

## üìù Prompt Engineering Details

### **PROMPT 1: Daily Workout Generation** (`/api/workout`)

**Location:** `/Users/siddhantatrish/Desktop/AITrainerOctober/app/api/workout/route.ts` (Lines 298-303)

**Prompt Structure:**
```
${GUIDELINES}

User Context:
${context}
```

**Full Prompt Template:**

````markdown
You are a strength coach, and your goal is to suggest a personalized workout plan for **today** based on the user's inputs.

---

üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Workout Structure:**
Divide the workout into the following sections:
1. Warmup
2. Main Workout
3. Cardio
4. Cooldown

üí° For Cardio: Consider if the user plays a sport or has any preferred form of cardio.

---

üß† **Guardrails for Main Workout:**

**Fatigue & Split:**  
Understand the user's recent split and fatigue (from recent workouts). Avoid training the same muscle group as yesterday or over-fatiguing any area.

**Volume:**  
- Total exercises per session: 5‚Äì8  
- Exercises per muscle per day: ‚â§ 5  

**Variety:**  
Include different movement patterns within each muscle group.  
Vary across:
- **Type:** machine vs free weights  
- **Movement Type:** compound vs isolation  
- **Form:** standing / seated / incline / flat / decline / overhead / below-head  
- **Club:** press / fly / row / hinge / squat / lunge  
Avoid redundant selections (e.g., Barbell Bench Press + Dumbbell Bench Press).

**Difficulty Level (Based on Experience):**

- **Beginner (0‚Äì1 month):**  
  Exclude all barbell compound lifts (squat, deadlift, overhead press, barbell row), Olympic lifts, behind-the-neck variations, advanced core moves, and plyometrics.  
  Use stable, machine-based, or simple dumbbell/bodyweight exercises only.

- **Novice (1‚Äì3 months):**  
  Avoid Olympic lifts, behind-the-neck movements, advanced plyometrics, and very high-skill barbell lifts (snatch, clean & jerk).  
  You may introduce barbell squat, bench, and deadlift in light variations with strict form and low load.

---

üßæ **Final Output Format (JSON only):**

Return the plan in **this exact JSON format**:

{
  "today": [
    {
      "section": "Warmup",
      "exercises": [
        "Exercise 1",
        "Exercise 2"
      ]
    },
    {
      "section": "Main Workout",

- Provide 4-5 short reasoning explanations (5-6 words each)
- Explain WHY this specific workout was chosen based on the user's context
- Focus on training logic, recovery, balance, and progression
- Reference user's recent workouts, goals, and experience level
- Keep language simple and educational
- Examples: "Avoiding chest after yesterday", "Upper body for balance", "Compound for efficiency", "Beginner-safe exercises only", "Recovery day for legs"

Return only this JSON ‚Äî no text or commentary.

User Context:
[User's onboarding data, experience level, goals, equipment, recent workouts, etc.]
````

**Expected Response Format:**
```json
{
  "today": [
    { "section": "Warmup", "exercises": [...] },
    { "section": "Main Workout", "exercises": [...] },
    { "section": "Cardio", "exercises": [...] },
    { "section": "Cooldown", "exercises": [...] }
  ],
  "ai_coach_tips": ["Tip 1", "Tip 2", "Tip 3", "Tip 4"]
}
```

**Post-Processing:**
- JSON parsing with fallback to hardcoded workout if parsing fails

### **PROMPT 2: Weight Suggestions** (`/api/suggest-weights-ai`)

**Location:** `/Users/siddhantatrish/Desktop/AITrainerOctober/app/api/suggest-weights-ai/route.ts` (Lines 5-87)

**Prompt Structure:**
```
[System Instructions]
## User Profile Context:
{user_context}

## Exercise Details:
{exercise_details}

[Guidelines]

[Output Format]
```

**Full Prompt Template:**

````markdown
You are an expert strength coach and exercise physiologist. Your task is to suggest optimal sets, reps, and weights for exercises based on the user's profile and exercise details.

## User Profile Context:
{user_context}

## Exercise Details:
{exercise_details}

## Guidelines for Weight Suggestions:

### 1. **Experience-Based Recommendations:**
- **Beginner (0-1 month)**: Start with very light weights, focus on form
- **Novice (1-3 months)**: Light to moderate weights, building confidence
- **Intermediate (3-12 months)**: Moderate weights, progressive overload
- **Advanced (1+ years)**: Higher weights, advanced techniques

### 2. **Exercise-Specific Considerations:**
- **Compound movements** (squat, deadlift, bench press): Higher weight, lower reps
- **Isolation exercises** (curls, extensions): Lower weight, higher reps
- **Machine exercises**: Can handle slightly higher weights safely
- **Dumbbell exercises**: Consider unilateral strength differences

### 3. **Set and Rep Guidelines:**
- **Strength focus**: 3-5 sets, 4-6 reps, higher weight
- **Hypertrophy focus**: 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, moderate weight
- **Endurance focus**: 2-3 sets, 15+ reps, lighter weight
- **Beginner focus**: 2-3 sets, 10-15 reps, very light weight

### 4. **Progressive Loading:**
- **Warmup sets**: 50-70% of working weight
- **Working sets**: 80-100% of target weight
- **Final set**: Can be 100-110% for advanced users

### 5. **Safety Considerations:**
- Never suggest weights that could cause injury
- Consider user's body weight for relative strength
- Account for gender differences in strength standards
- Ensure proper form can be maintained

## Output Format:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "exercise_name": "Exercise Name",
  "sets": [
    {
      "id": "set-1",
      "type": "warmup",
      "reps": 10,
      "weight": 20,
      "completed": false
    },
    {
      "id": "set-2", 
      "type": "working",
      "reps": 8,
      "weight": 30,
      "completed": false
    },
    {
      "id": "set-3",
      "type": "working", 
      "reps": 8,
      "weight": 30,
      "completed": false
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these weights were chosen (2-3 sentences)",
  "safety_notes": "Any important safety considerations for this exercise"
}

## Important Notes:
- Weight should be in kg
- Include 2-4 sets total
- First set should be warmup (50-70% of working weight)
- Subsequent sets should be working sets
- Consider the user's experience level and body weight
- Ensure weights are realistic and safe
- Provide reasoning for your choices

Return only the JSON, no additional text or formatting.
````

**Example Input:**
```json
{
  "user_context": "Male, 25 years old, 75kg, intermediate level (6 months experience), goal: hypertrophy, no injuries",
  "exercise_details": "Barbell Bench Press - 3 sets of 8-10 reps",
  "user_id": "user-123"
}
```

**Expected Response Format:**
```json
{
  "exercise_name": "Barbell Bench Press",
  "sets": [
    { "id": "set-1", "type": "warmup", "reps": 10, "weight": 40, "completed": false },
    { "id": "set-2", "type": "working", "reps": 8, "weight": 60, "completed": false },
    { "id": "set-3", "type": "working", "reps": 8, "weight": 60, "completed": false }
  ],
  "reasoning": "At 6 months experience, you can handle moderate loads. 60kg (~80% of estimated 1RM) is appropriate for hypertrophy in the 8-rep range. Warmup at 40kg ensures joints and muscles are prepared.",
  "safety_notes": "Keep feet planted, back arched slightly, and bar path straight over mid-chest. Use a spotter for safety."
}
```

**Post-Processing:**
- JSON cleaning (removes markdown fences)
- Stored in `weight_suggestions` table in Supabase
- Added to workout plan under `weight_suggestions` key

**Generation Strategy:**
- **Initial Workout:** Generate weights for ALL exercises
- **Workout Changes:** Only generate weights for NEW exercises (reuse existing for unchanged exercises)
- **Rate Limiting:** 2-second delay between consecutive calls

## üéØ Key Features

### **1. Dynamic Context Management**

The system maintains TWO types of context:

- **Onboarding Context (Static):** User's initial setup data (age, weight, goals, experience, equipment, etc.)
- **User Context (Dynamic):** Updated continuously from chat conversations
  - Format: Paragraph text with key information
  - Updated via `mergeContextParagraph()` function
  - Persisted in `chat_sessions.user_context`
  - Used in ALL subsequent AI calls

**Context Merging Logic:**
```typescript
function mergeContextParagraph(existingContext: string, delta: ContextDelta): string {
  // 1. Parse existing context into structured format
  // 2. Merge new values from delta
  // 3. Remove duplicates
  // 4. Convert back to paragraph format
  // 5. Return updated context
}
```

### **2. Workout Change Flow**

```
User: "Add barbell squats and leg press"
    ‚Üì
Chat API (/api/chat) ‚Üí Detects change request ‚Üí Returns should_propose_changes: true
    ‚Üì
Frontend: Calls /api/chat/propose-workout-changes
    ‚Üì
Backend: Generates new workout + weights for new exercises only
    ‚Üì
Frontend: Shows confirmation dialog with change summary + new exercises
    ‚Üì
User: Clicks "Confirm Changes"
    ‚Üì
Frontend: Calls /api/chat/confirm-workout-changes
    ‚Üì
Backend: Marks proposal as accepted, returns new workout
    ‚Üì
Frontend: Updates workout state + localStorage + closes chat + refreshes page
    ‚Üì
User: Sees updated workout immediately
```

### **3. Weight Generation Optimization**

**Problem:** Generating weights for all exercises is slow and hits rate limits

**Solution:**
- **Initial Workout:** Generate for ALL exercises (unavoidable)
- **Workout Modifications:** Generate ONLY for NEW exercises
- **Reuse:** Keep existing weight suggestions for unchanged exercises
- **Rate Limiting:** 2-second delay between API calls
- **Model Change:** Switched from `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` to `gemini-2.0-flash` (more stable)

**Example:**
```
Current Workout: [Exercise A, Exercise B, Exercise C] (all have weights)
User Request: "Add Exercise D and Exercise E"
New Workout: [Exercise A, Exercise B, Exercise D, Exercise E]

Weight Generation:
‚úÖ Exercise A: Reuse existing
‚úÖ Exercise B: Reuse existing
üîÑ Exercise D: Generate new (2s delay)
üîÑ Exercise E: Generate new (2s delay)

Result: Only 2 API calls instead of 5
```

## üìà Recent Improvements (October 2025)

### ‚úÖ **Batch Weight Generation API** (Implemented)
- **New Endpoint:** `/api/suggest-weights-batch`
- **Benefit:** Generate weights for ALL exercises in ONE API call
- **Performance:** ~80-90% faster than individual calls
- **Fallback:** Automatically falls back to individual calls if batch fails
- **Usage:** 
  ```javascript
  POST /api/suggest-weights-batch
  {
    "user_context": "...",
    "exercises": ["Exercise 1", "Exercise 2", "Exercise 3"],
    "user_id": "..."
  }
  ```

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced Weight Guidelines** (Implemented)
- **Equipment-specific calculations:**
  - Dumbbells: Weight for ONE dumbbell (user holds two)
  - Barbells: Includes 20kg bar weight
- **Gym-realistic rounding:**
  - Dumbbells: 2.5kg increments
  - Barbells: 5kg increments (multiples of 5)
- **Intelligent set progression:** No duplicate sets with same weight/reps
- **Warmup requirements:**
  - Compound exercises: 2 warmup + 3 working sets
  - Isolation/Machine: 3 working sets only
- **Strength standards:** Based on bodyweight multipliers for 30+ exercises

### üîÆ Future Improvements

1. **Caching:** Cache workout plans and weight suggestions for faster load times
2. **Progressive Enhancement:** Load workout first, then stream weight suggestions
3. **Context Compression:** Summarize chat history to reduce token usage
4. **User Feedback Loop:** Learn from user's weight adjustments to improve suggestions
5. **Real-time Progress Tracking:** Show "Generating weights..." status in UI
